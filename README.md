# AI-and-ML-for-Water-Quality-Analysis-and-Prediction

## Overview

This project predicts Water Quality Index (WQI) using machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The models are trained using an IoT-based approach to calculate WQI values.

## Google Colab Notebook

Explore the entire project in a Google Colab notebook: [wqi_prediction.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10qpOhiLe4c1IoDrUSYaeDfXuOFxydekj#scrollTo=oMB94qe-gCeP)

## Usage

1. Open the [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10qpOhiLe4c1IoDrUSYaeDfXuOFxydekj#scrollTo=oMB94qe-gCeP).
2. Run the notebook to train and evaluate the machine learning models.

## Project Structure

- `wqi_prediction.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook containing all the code.

## Results

The project results, including metrics such as RMSE, MAE, R-squared, and Explained Variance, are displayed within the notebook.

## Inference

Explore visualizations and make inferences about model performance, the relationship between actual and predicted values, and feature importance within the notebook.
